# Our goal here focuses primarily on prediction in which we seek to predict the
# distribution of the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum) across the states of Oregon and
# Washington, USA using data collected over a four year period from 2016-2019. We
# will compare a variety of multi-season occupancy models in accomplishing this task.
# Note that the models we fit here differ from those used in the actual publication,
# which fits a slightly different form of multi-season occupancy model (and do so
# in a multi-species framework). We will fit and compare the four models that we discussed in lecture:
# (1) Unstructured site random effect and unstructured year random effect
# (2) Unstructured site random effect and AR(1) year random effect
# (3) Spatial random effect and unstructured year random effect
# (4) Spatial random effect and AR(1) year random effect

# All models will include the same covariates on occupancy and detection, which are
# as follows
# Occupancy covariates (all static over time):
#    1. Log forest cover (standardized across study region)
#    2. 30-year average precipitation (standardized across study region)
#    3. Cliff and canyon cover (standardized across study region)
# Detection covariates:
#    1. Vegetation clutter
#    2. Binary variable indicating whether the sampling location was near water or not.
#    3. Average minimum temperature

# Note that the detection-nondetection data are currently formatted for a
# multi-species, multi-season occupancy model. For those models, the detection
# nondetection data y are stored in a four-dimensional array with dimensions
# corresponding to species, site, primary time period, and secondary time period.
# Below, we select a single species (the spotted bat, EUMA) that we will work with here.

# For single-species multi-season occupancy models the detection-nondetection data
# are formatted in a three-dimensional array with dimensions corresponding to
# site, primary time period (in this case year), and secondary time period.

# Exploratory data analysis -----------------------------------------------
# The detection-nondetection data come from 10 x 10km grid cells across the
# two states. Below we load the prediction data, which contains covariate information
# for grid cells across the entire region as well as an sf object that we will
# use to make a quick plot showing the grid cells that we have sampled across our
# region of interest.

# Loads three objects: (1) X.pred (design matrix for prediction); (2) coords.pred
# (grid cell coordinates for prediction); and (3) nw.grid (an sf object for
# generating maps of the region)
load('data/wright2021BatPredictionData.rda')

# once over the four year period.

# Fit models --------------------------------------------------------------
# Next we fit the four candidate models. The models with an unstructured site
# random effect (non-spatial models) will be fit with tPGOcc(). The spatial models
# are fit with stPGOcc(). Note that ALL multi-season models use "n.batch" and
# "batch.length" arguments to specify the MCMC samples. This is because the
# AR1 temporal autocorrelation parameter is also a "difficult to sample" parameter,
# and so we need to use the Adaptive MCMC sampler we have discussed previously.

# MCMC criteria we will use for all four models

# Unstructured site and year ----------
# Specify slightly informative priors on the site and year random effects to restrict
# extremely large values. These priors give a prior mean of 0.5 to the random effect
# variances with an infinite variance, and so they are still fairly weakly informative,
# but perhaps a bit less so than the default values of 0.1 and 0.1 for the inverse-Gamma
# shape and scale parameters.
