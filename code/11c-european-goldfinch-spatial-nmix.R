# 11c-european-goldfinch-spatial-nmix.R: in the previous exercise, we used simulated
#                                        data to show how to fit spatial N-mixture
#                                        models, and saw that everything went very
#                                        smoothly. Here we will work with a real
#                                        data set (the same European Goldfinch
#                                        data we worked with in our occupancy modeling
#                                        section but now using the raw counts). We will
#                                        see how spatial (and non-spatial) N-mixture models
#                                        can be difficult to estimate in practice and can
#                                        show very bad convergence properties.
