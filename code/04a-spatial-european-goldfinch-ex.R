# 04a-spatial-european-goldfinch-ex.R: in this exercise, you will build on the script
#                                      1-swiss-european-goldfinch.R by extending
#                                      our occupancy model to a spatial
#                                      occupancy model that you will use to
#                                      predict the distribution of the European
#                                      goldfinch across Switzerland.

# In this example, your goal is to produce a species distribution map of the
# European goldfinch throughout Switzerland. Based on what we found in
# 1-swiss-european-goldfinch.R, the top performing non-spatial occupancy model
# included a linear effect of forest cover and a linear and quadratic effect of
# elevation. Here you will compare this model to a spatial model and interpret the
# results from the spatial model.

# NOTE: we label the tasks in exercises throughout the course that you need to
#       complete with the label TODO, followed by the associated number.

# Data prep ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Read in the data source (reads in an object called data.goldfinch)
load("data/europeanGoldfinchSwiss.rda")
str(data.goldfinch)
# Take a quick look at the spatial locations
plot(data.goldfinch$coords, pch = 19)

# TODO 4.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Fit a non-spatial occupancy model that includes a linear effect
# of forest cover and linear and quadratic effects of elevation. # Recall that
# we fit this exact model in "1-swiss-european-goldfinch.R". Make sure that the
# model converged. How do you know? Save the resulting model results in an
# object called "out.non.sp". Use default initial values and prior distributions.

# TODO 4.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Fit the same model as in TODO 4.1, but now include a spatial random effect
# (i.e., fit a spatial occupancy model with the same covariates). Use an
# NNGP with 10 neighbors and an exponential spatial covariance function.
# Set the initial value of the spatial variance
# (sigma.sq) to 3 and the initial value of the spatial decay parameter to
# 3 divided by the mean distance between sites in the data set (you can calculate
# the distance matrix of all sites using the dist() function). Run three chains
# of the model for 5000 samples each , split into batches each with 25
# MCMC samples. Set the initial tuning variance for phi to 0.5.
# Determine if the model has converged. Throw away the first 3000 samples as burn-in,
# and use a thinning rate of 4 to only keep 500 samples per chain. Call the model
# output out.sp.1. Has the model converged with these MCMC settings?

# TODO 4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Refit the same model as before, but now manually specify the prior on phi to
# have an effective spatial range that falls between 10,000 and the maximum
# distance between two sites in the data set. Recall that the effective spatial
# range when using the exponential covariance function is 3 / phi. Save the
# model as out.sp.2.

# TODO 4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Fit the model a third time using the priors specified in
# TODO 4.3 where now you adjust the MCMC settings (e.g., increase
# the number of samples, potentially change the burn-in and thinning rates) to
# ensure that the model converges. Call the model "out.sp.3". Show evidence
# that the model has converged. Which parameters appear to be the parameters
# that are slowest to converge? Note that you will have to run the model for a
# couple of minutes in order to get it to converge.

# TODO 4.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Use the ppcOcc() function to perform a posterior predictive check that
# assesses the model fit for the spatial model. Use the freeman-tukey test statistic, and perform
# two posterior checks: one that groups the data by site prior to calculating
# the test statistic, and one that groups the data by visit prior to calculating
# the test statistic. See ?ppcOcc for details. Use the summary() function to
# calculate the Bayesian p-value and adapt code shown in the introductory
# package vignette (https://www.jeffdoser.com/files/spoccupancy-web/articles/modelfitting#posterior-predictive-checks)
# to visualize the Bayesian p-value.

# TODO 4.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Use waicOcc() to compare the non-spatial model to the spatial model. Which
# model performs better according to the WAIC?

# TODO 4.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Use four-fold cross validation to compare the non-spatial model to the spatial
# model. Run the same code you used to fit the two models previously, but now
# specify the arguments needed for k-fold cross-validation. Note that you can set
# the k.fold.only argument to solely perform cross-validation and not re-run the
# entire full model. Which model performs the best?

# TODO 4.7 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Using code from "1-swiss-european-goldfinch.R" predict occupancy of the
# European goldfinch across Switzerland. Call your resulting prediction
# object out.pred. Make sure to load in the necessary
# covariate data, which are available in "data/switzerlandPredData.rda". Make
# a species distribution map of the mean occupancy probability across the country.
# Also plot the standard deviation as a map of the uncertainty with our estimates.

# Load prediction objects (loads objects pred.swiss and coords.0)
load("data/switzerlandPredData.rda")
str(pred.swiss)

# TODO 4.8 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# In addition to making a map of the predicted occupancy probability, it can
# be very enlightening to plot the resulting predictions of the spatial random
# effects. The posterior predictive samples of the predicted spatial random effects
# are available in "out.pred$w.0.samples". Adapt your code from TODO 4.7 to now
# generate a plot of the spatial random effects across the country.
